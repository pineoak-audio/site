Recently, I had the privilege of delving into a unique OST composing jam with Haasio, a multi-talented individual renowned for her prowess in music, game development, concept art, UI/UX design, and, interestingly, her amphibious nature.</p> <p>What\u2019s a jam?</p> <p>In the context of music and creative collaboration, a \u201cjam\u201d typically refers to an informal gathering or session where musicians come together to improvise, experiment, and create music.</p> <p>That jam had a theme. We could choose either the theme \u201cTick Tock\u2026\u201d or the picture theme, or both!</p> <p></p> <p>Our submission, titled \u201cCountdown Showdown,\u201d features five distinct tracks that blend classical and digital elements into a harmonious clash.</p> <ul> <li>Lord Tockula (Mareoceu)</li> <li>Infinity Before Midnight (Mareoceu)</li> <li>Lady Bellaticks (Haasio)</li> <li>Battle Tango (Haasio)</li> <li>Countdown Showdown (Mareoceu + Haasio)</li> </ul> <p>\u201cCountdown Showdown\u201d is not your typical OST. It\u2019s a fusion of analog and digital sounds, meticulously crafted to narrate the tale of a thrilling duel between two clockbots. Divided into two halves, each representing the contrasting worlds of analog and digital.</p> <p>The theme of \u201cTick Tock\u201d echoes throughout the entire composition, with each track featuring rhythmic patterns that mimic the sound of ticking clocks. Furthermore, the characters portrayed in the songs are intricately themed after clocks and possess their own voices.</p> <p>Lady Bellticks (saxophone) and Lord Tockula (theremin) present themselves and then battle against each other following a common leitmotif, adding depth to the narrative and reinforcing the central theme.</p> <p>The first half of our submission delves into the realm of digital music production, created with precision using FL Studio. Here, electronic elements merge with dance music rhythms, creating a futuristic vibe that invites listeners to explore the possibilities of modern soundscapes.</p> <p>In contrast, the second half of \u201cCountdown Showdown\u201d embraces the warmth of battle tango. Crafted using LMMS, these tracks exude a rich, textured sound reminiscent of traditional instrumentation. Drawing from the elegance of tango music, this half offers a timeless yet contemporary experience.</p> <p>\u201cCountdown Showdown\u201d is more than just a collection of songs; it\u2019s a testament to the power of collaboration and creativity.</p>","tags":["ost jam","itch","haasio"]},{"location":"blog/2023/07/ost-composing-jam/#thank-you","title":"Thank you!","text":"<p>We\u2019re thrilled to offer the soundtrack of \u201cCountdown Showdown\u201d under the Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC), granting permission for non-commercial projects to utilize the music.</p> <p>You can download the full album at itch.io.</p>","tags":["ost jam","itch","haasio"]},{"location":"blog/2024/12/happy-new-years-eve/","title":"Happy New Year's Eve!","text":"<p>We hope you are all having fun and wish you all the best for the new year!</p> <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.</p>","tags":["new year","hogmanay","festive season"]},{"location":"blog/2024/12/happy-new-years-eve/#subtitulo-do-post","title":"Subt\u00edtulo do post","text":"<p>Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor.
